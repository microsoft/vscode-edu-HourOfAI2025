title: Lesson 1
description: Explore Artificial Intelligence and prompt engineering by competing
  in a fast-paced Snake game tournament!
objectives: >-
  The Slither Slam lesson is designed to be a fun introductory experience with
  Game AI algorithms, prompt engineering and code generation.  In this activity,
  you will code your own “SnakeBot” to compete against other AI snake algorithms
  in a tournament.  

  You will learn about AI concepts such as:

  - What is Artificial Intelligence

  - Large Language Models (LLM)

  - Prompt Engineering best practices

  - Game AI and autonomous algorithms

  - AI Agents

  - Testing and debugging
